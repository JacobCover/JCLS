Jake's Custom Link Shortener

A link shortener that I made without any idea of how to make a link shorterner!
I plan to mainly use this to get data on my own site's link usage.
Programed in Python using Flask and SQL-Alchemy because that's what I know best 
Literally no guarantees that this is even a partly good system
